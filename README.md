# Relativistic Space Travel Simulation
## Overview
This Python project simulates relativistic space travel, allowing users to explore the effects of traveling close 
to the speed of light. By configuring various parameters, users can visualize the journey to distant stars, including 
relativistic effects on time, distance and the apparence of stars. (See document.pdf for a complete
introduction of the physics and astronomy behind the project)

## Features
1. Configurable settings via 'settings.ini' file
2. Supports Hipparcos; Hipparcos-Tycho or customized star catalogs
3. Adjustable parameters for star plotting (size based on magnitudes)
4. Output in customizable pixel dimensions
5. Option to generate series of images for animation

To run this project, you need Python 3 installed on your machine.
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xna24/Space_Travel_Simulator.git
cd Space_Travel_Simulator
```
3. Installed required packages
