# Relativistic Space Travel Simulation
## Overview
This Python project simulates relativistic space travel, allowing users to explore the effects of traveling close 
to the speed of light. By configuring various parameters, users can visualize the journey to distant stars, including 
relativistic effects on time, distance and the apparence of stars. (See document.pdf for a complete
introduction of the physics and astronomy behind the project)
